        <p>A Security Operations Center is a centralized unit that continuously monitors and improves an organization's security posture while preventing, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. It's a hub of expertise, technology, and processes that provides real-time surveillance to keep your business safe.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why SMBs Need SOC Services</h2>
        <p>In today's digital age, cyber threats are evolving rapidly, and SMBs are increasingly becoming targets. Without adequate protection, your business is vulnerable to attacks that can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and damage to your reputation.
